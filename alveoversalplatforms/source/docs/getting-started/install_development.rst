Installation Guide for Platform Development Packages
##########################################################################

The `VitisÂ® Unified Software Platform`_ can be used to develop applications for use with the Alveo datacenter accelerator cards. To set up an accelerator card platform for use in the Vitis development environment, follow the installation steps in `Vitis Software Platform Installation`_ (UG1393).

.. note::
    The development package installation will require a minimum version of XRT to be installed. When installing XRT using the instructions referenced above please install the specific version of XRT linked to in the table below.


.. # TODO Vitis documentation needs to be updated to link to this site in future for Versal Platforms (today it is referencing UG1120 for VUP), and it should link back to here or add a section for accelerator platform dev pkg installation.

After installing Vitis and XRT, install the desired Development Package as listed in the table below. This shall install the necessary platform files into ``/opt/xilinx/platforms`` where Vitis will automatically look for them when creating an application.
